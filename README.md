# LVP
## - a light-weight video player
As the name may or may not suggest, LVP stands for "Light-weight Video Player"

## What it can do
The "light" int LVP may or may not stand for the limited set of tools in this app. But really, what *should* a video player really be able to do except for playing back *videos*?
#### It is very simple:
It can only playback videos and, for comfort, it includes two sliders, one for volume and one for seeking throught the video.

# Performance
It is yet to be very performant, considering it's in its alpha stages (maybe "light" wouldn't be the best description in terms of performance). Thought it is only a couple of megabytes in size (~3.8MB to be exact!).

# Development
It is written in Rust, Typescript and uses [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com) as its front-end framework. For its back-end, it uses [Tauri](https://tauri.app).
